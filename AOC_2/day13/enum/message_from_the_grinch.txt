Nice work, Santa!

Wow, this house sure was DIRTY!
I think they deserve coal for Christmas, don't you?
So let's leave some coal under the Christmas `tree`!

Let's work together on this. Leave this text file here,
and leave the christmas.sh script here too...
but, create a file named `coal` in this directory!
Then, inside this directory, pipe the output
of the `tree` command into the `md5sum` command.

The output of that command (the hash itself) is
the flag you can submit to complete this task
for the Advent of Cyber!
