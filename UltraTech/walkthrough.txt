					Task 1 Deploy the machine

ï»¿~_. UltraTech ._~

This room is inspired from real-life vulnerabilities and misconfigurations I encountered during security assessments.

If you get stuck at some point, take some time to keep enumerating.


[ Your Mission ]

You have been contracted by UltraTech to pentest their infrastructure.

It is a grey-box kind of assessment, the only information you have

is the company's name and their server's IP address.

Start this room by hitting the "deploy" button on the right!


Good luck and more importantly, have fun!
