					Task 2 Discovering the Lay of the Land
					

Deploy the virtual machine attached to this task. This deployment period will take about two minutes at the most.
'''
no answer
'''


Scan the machine with Nmap. What non-standard service can be found running on the high-port?
'''
Webmin
'''


Further enumerate this service, what version of it is running?
'''
1.890
'''


Visit the webpage generated by this service. You should encounter an error due to SSL being present. Change the URL to use HTTPS and ignore the exception. After this, view the certificate. What hostname can we find on the cert details? On Firefox, you can view this by clicking on the 'i' in the URL, then the '>' in Connection, 'More Information', and then 'View Certificate' on the Security tab.
'''
source
'''



Adjust your /etc/hosts file accordingly to include the newly discovered hostname and revisit the webpage in question. Note, that this will confirm that the service we previously discovered using Nmap is correct. Once you've done this, move onto task three.

					Task 3 Learning to Fly
					
The AKB dashboard at the time of writing. Note, we won't have to log in for what we're doing. That being said, logging in (via GitHub OAuth) allows us to post and contribute to discussions surrounding vulnerabilities.

AKB allows us to search for various vulnerabilities via the search bar at the top right of the site. Search now for 'Webmin' and click on 'password_change.cgi'
'''
no answer
'''

Which version of Webmin is immediately vulnerable to this exploit?
'''
1.890
'''



What type of attack was this? Note, we're looking for how this was added to the code for Webmin, not how this results in remote code execution (RCE).
'''
supply chain
'''


Can you find a link to a post on the webmin's website explaining what happened? What day was Webmin informed of an 0day exploit?
'''
August 17th 2019
'''


Last but certainly not least, let's find the link to our exploit. We can see in the Assessments that a Metasploit module was added for this backdoor. What pull number was this added in?
'''
12219
'''


Once you've located the exploit, let's move onto task four!

					Task 4 Blasting Away

Launch Metasploit now as we'll be leveraging the Metasploit module for this exploit. 
'''
no answer
'''


With Metasploit open, search for and select the exploit we previously investigated.
'''
no answer
'''


Now that we've selected our exploit, set the options provided appropriately. Beyond RHOSTS and LHOST, what is the third option we must set to 'True'?
'''
ssl
'''


Run the exploit. What is the user flag?
'''
THM{SUPPLY_CHAIN_COMPROMISE}
''


How about the root flag?
'''
THM{UPDATE_YOUR_INSTALL}
'''


Once you've completed gaining the root flag, move onto the fifth and final task.
