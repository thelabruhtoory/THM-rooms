----------------
When SSHD tries to authenticate a non-existing user, it will pick up a fake password structure hardcoded in the SSHD 
source code. On this hard coded  password  structure  the password hash is based on BLOWFISH ($2) algorithm.
If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512, then sending large passwords (10KB)  will result in shorter 
response time from the server for non-existing users.


(Valid users will result in higher total time).

*** please note that if SSHD configuration prohibits root login , then root is not considered as valid user...

*** when TCP timestamp option is enabled the best way to measure the time would be using timestamps from the TCP 
packets of the server, since this will eliminate any network delays on the way.
