 Task 1 Iron Corp

Iron Corp suffered a security breach not long time ago.

You have been chosen by Iron Corp to conduct a penetration test of their asset. They did system hardening and are expecting you not to be able to access their system.

The asset in scope is: ironcorp.me

Note: Edit your config file and add ironcorp.me

Note 2: It might take around 5-7 minutes for the VM to fully boot, so please be patient.





Happy hacking!
